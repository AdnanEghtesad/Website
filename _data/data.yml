        company: Cornell University
        details: |
            - Developing high performance machine/deep learning and neural network (NN) based
              constitutive modelling to create a hybrid framework that can work on limited amount
              of data by relying on the modularity of the constitutive formulation. Fundamental part
              of this work is the design of experiments as well as the development of theoretical and
              numerical frameworks to study and predict the flow response of metallic materials.
